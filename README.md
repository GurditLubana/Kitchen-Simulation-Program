# Title: **Kitchen Simulation Program**
 

# **Purpose**
The basic purpose of this project is to build a event driven simulation to simulate a restaurant chef handling food orders using C++. 

There are three different simulations in this project. 
- First come first served Simulation: This means, the order which will come first will be servered first if it is not expired.
- Last come first server: This means the order which will be the most recent one will be served first.
- Maximize revenue Simulation: This simulation means, the chef will always look at all the unexpired orders and prepare the one that costs the most first. 


## **User Instructions**: 
	
	- There is a Makefile created to compile and run all the files.
	- User needs to type make in order to run Makefile.
	- Makefile will create a make function called A2.
	- User needs to input [A2] [name of the file following by .txt in " "] [version of simulation]
	- This program works perfectly fine and give required output for the file test.txt.
